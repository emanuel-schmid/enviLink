    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "For building _enviLink_, we employed python scripts centred around a local, temporary relational database that is used for storing intermediate results. The chemoinformatic core of the calculation was done in Java, making use of [CDK](https://cdk.github.io/), [Ambit2](http://ambit.sourceforge.net/index.html) as well as envipath.org's own Java library."

    "#### Standardization\n",
    "To account for different SMILES potentially representing the same compound (e.g., different protonation states or tautomers), each compound in the database was subjected to a set of standardizers. Where applicable, these standardizers generated different SMILES strings, representing possible states of a molecule (e.g. differently protonated species, different tautomers etc.). All SMILES strings that were newly generated through the application of standardizers remained connected to the original compound by keeping track of their provenience. <br>"

    "Each reaction substrate, original or standardized, was then combined with every biotransformation rule (btrule) of the Eawag-BBD database. Whenever a btrule was triggered by a given substrate SMILES string, the resulting reaction (i.e., substrate-product pair) was inserted into the database together with a link to the respective rule that triggered it. If the product SMILES string was unknown to the database prior to the triggering of this reaction, it was again standardized in the way described above and inserted into the database."

In the following, more details on the matching algorithm are given."

    "To efficiently compare predicted reactions with database reactions despite the previously applied standardization rules, two or more compounds were considered equivalent if they were directly or indirectly linked by any _standardization_ step taken above. The set of all equvivalent compounds is then termed _equivalence class_. In this way, each reaction was assigned to a formal reaction with the substrates' equivalence class as substrate and the products' equivalence classes as products. Hence, \"in silico\" reactions and database reactions were compared based on the IDs of the substrate and product equivalence classes rather than on actual chemical structure."

    "Because Eawag-BBD btrules do not produce fully stoichiometrically balanced reactions nor consider any co-factors, another step was included in the match finder algorithm to account for this, particularly when comparing predicted reactions with KEGG database reactions. This was done by removing any compounds from the database reactions that were considered non-essential. Specifically, salts, water, protons, electrons and small organic compounds were removed. Further, co-factors were removed if they were present as complete pairs in the reaction equation (e.g., pairs like NADH/NAD+, ATP/ADP)."

The outer ends of this transformation graph were then compared to the database products' equivalence classes. Whenever all products in the database products' equivalence classes were found in this graph, a _match_ was noted, containing the original reaction and the rule(s) associated with the _in silico_ reaction(s) leading to the product(s)."
